/**
 * A NamingConvention that extracts Shards out of the freeFormDetails component of a name.
 *
 * Shards are only considered in the leading portion of the freeFormDetails, and are extracted while
 * present, leaving any remaining portion of the details as the unprocessed portion of the NamingResult.
 *
 * A shard has a numeric id greater than 0.
 * The first component of a shard value must be a non digit (leading digits get consumed into the shardId)
 * A shard value can contain ASCII letters, digits, as well as '.', '_', '^', and '~'
 *
 * A specification for the ShardingNamingConvention follows:
 * <pre>
 * {@code
 * ; the naming convention operates on free-form-details:
 * free-form-details              = *free-form-detail-char
 *
 * ; shard extraction specification:
 * shards                         = [first-shard *additional-shard] [unprocessed]
 * first-shard                    = shard-content
 * additional-shard               = "-" shard-content
 * shard-content                  = "x" shard
 * shard                          = shard-id shard-value
 * shard-id                       = non-zero-digit *DIGIT
 * shard-value                    = shard-value-first-char *shard-value-remaining-char
 * unprocessed                    = *free-form-detail-char
 *
 * ; character sets:
 * non-zero-digit                 = %x31-39
 * shard-value-first-char         = ALPHA
 * shard-value-remaining-char     = shard-value-first-char / DIGIT
 * free-form-detail-char          = shard-value-remaining-char / "-"
 * }
 * </pre>
 *
 * If multiple shard tokens are present with the same shardId, the last value supplied takes precedence, and
 * the NamingResult will contain a warning indicating that there was a collision.
 *
 * If a shard appears to be present in the unprocessed portion of the freeFormDetails, this is noted as a warning.
